## Executive Summary

The **Open Venture Engine (OVE)** is a pre-wired, Web3-native infrastructure stack that allows anyone to deploy a fully autonomous Venture Capital agent.

OVE aggregates best-in-class execution primitives while structurally enforcing deterministic governance through Sigil’s execution firewall.

This ensures the agent cannot:

- Drain its own treasury
- Execute unauthorized trades
- Bypass fiduciary constraints
- Mutate infrastructure without policy approval

OVE is designed to demonstrate how autonomous capital deployment can operate within strict structural boundaries.

## Architecture Overview

OVE separates execution into three distinct layers:

### 🧠 The Brain
- **ELIZA / LangChain**
- Evaluates market conditions
- Proposes investments or yield strategies
- Generates structured transaction intent

### ⚙️ The Engine
- **Coinbase AgentKit**
- Handles wallet provisioning
- Formats EVM transactions
- Generates ERC-4337 UserOperations

- **[Sigil Sign](https://sign.sigilcore.com)**
- `@sigilcore/agent-hooks`
- Enforces deterministic `ASSURANCE.md` policy
- Issues short-lived Ed25519-signed **Intent Attestations**

No transaction may execute without a valid Intent Attestation.

---

## Identity & Yield Stack

OVE integrates modern Web3 primitives:

- **[ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551)** — Token Bound Accounts (VC Agent is the NFT)
- **[Safe (Gnosis)](https://safe.global/)** — Treasury custody
- **[Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/)** — Automated revenue streaming to the human GP
- **[ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)** — Account abstraction and programmable execution

All outbound execution must route through Sigil.

## The Sigil OS Independent Build Bounty

Building an Agentic VC this week? We are running an independent developer bounty parallel to ongoing ecosystem hackathons.

### The Challenge

The first developer or team to successfully route their ELIZA agent's transaction intents through the Sigil Sentry API (utilizing the Open Venture Engine) will receive a $1,500 USDC grant.

**Note:** This is an independent grant issued directly by Sigil Core and is not affiliated with or sponsored by third-party hackathon organizers. Payout is contingent on a successful, verifiable API integration and Intent Attestation generation.

---

### Submission Deadline

All qualifying integrations must be submitted and verifiable on or before **March 18, 2026 at 23:59 UTC**.

Submissions after this deadline will not be eligible for the grant.

---

### Verification Criteria

To qualify for the $1,500 USDC grant, the submission must demonstrate:

1. A live or reproducible ELIZA-based agent integration.
2. A real `POST /v1/authorize` request to `https://sign.sigilcore.com`.
3. Successful receipt of a valid Ed25519-signed **Intent Attestation**.
4. The Intent Attestation being appended to a real EOA transaction or ERC-4337 UserOperation.
5. On-chain verification that the transaction was executed only after authorization.

Mocked responses, simulated attestations, or hardcoded JWTs will not qualify.

---

## How Intent Attestation Works

Before execution:

1. The agent proposes a transaction.
2. The transaction intent is sent to `POST https://sign.sigilcore.com/v1/authorize`.
3. Sigil evaluates the request against `ASSURANCE.md`.
4. If compliant, Sigil returns a short-lived Ed25519-signed Intent Attestation.
5. The transaction is executed only if the attestation is appended.

If denied, the agent receives a deterministic JSON Rebound and must halt execution.

## Who OVE Is For

- Autonomous Venture Capital experiments
- DAO treasury automation
- Onchain investment protocols
- Agentic yield strategies
- Web3-native governance tooling

---

## The Strategic Goal

OVE demonstrates that autonomous capital deployment does not require blind trust.

By structurally enforcing deterministic authorization through Sigil Sign, OVE proves:

- Autonomous agents can operate within fiduciary boundaries
- Governance can be cryptographically enforced
- Liability can be bounded by architecture
- Execution can be provably authorized before capital moves
